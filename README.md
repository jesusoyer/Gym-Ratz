# Gym Ratz: Interactive Full-Stack Application

Gym-Ratz is a web application designed to help users find and save workouts fit for them made by friends or fitness gurus alike without the hassle of doing their own research.

Our motivation for development was creating an application that serves to make exercise readily accessible to people of all fitness levels. With the functionality of a public domain where one can upload a curated workout plan, users can easily begin their fitness journey from the comfort of their own home as well as give trainers & professions a way to share their expertise.  

As a user, I am able to sign up for Gym Ratz with a username, email, and password, post workout sets, and save workouts from other users onto their profile.

In Phase 1 of our project you will be able to see authentication, GET/POST workouts.
